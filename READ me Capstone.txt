# House Price Prediction Model

This project demonstrates how to build and deploy a house price prediction model using the **Boston Housing Dataset**. The model uses **Random Forest Regressor** for predicting house prices based on various features like crime rate, average number of rooms, and more.

The project involves the following key steps:
1. **Data Collection**: Loading the dataset from a URL.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Checking for missing values and duplicates.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing the dataset using pair plots and correlation heatmaps.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Preparing the feature matrix and target variable.
5. **Model Building**: Using **Random Forest Regressor** with hyperparameter tuning.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.
7. **Model Deployment**: Saving and loading the model for future predictions.

## Tech Stack

- **Python**: The primary programming language used.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Numpy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **Seaborn**: For advanced visualizations.
- **Scikit-learn**: For building the machine learning model and evaluation.
- **Joblib**: For saving and loading the model.
